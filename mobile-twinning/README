This adds the mobile-twinning app.

Works like this:

Go to Apps -> Mobile Twinning. Associate the mobile number with the corresponding extension.
Go to Dialplan -> Destinations. Map a Destination to the mobile-twinning dialplan number. (*662) (spells MOB for "mobile")

You can now seamlessly move calls back and forth from your deskphone and your mobile.
If someone calls your extension and you have it forwarded (or follow-me) to your mobile, you can dial *662 from your desk to bring the call back to your desk.
If you are on your deskphone, you can dial the mobile-twinning destination (step 2), press 1 and the call is transferred to your mobile.

Notes:

This will probably not work across multiple FS servers as it is written.
This is setup for the mobile to have a 10 digit number.
